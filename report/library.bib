abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate extraction of silicon waveguide geometry with sub-nanometer accuracy using optical measurements. Effective and group indices of silicon on insulator (SOI) waveguides are extracted from the optical measurements. An accurate model linking the geometry of an SOI waveguide to its effective and group indices is used to extract the linewidths and thicknesses within respective errors of 0.37 nm and 0.26 nm on a die fabricated by the IMEC multi-project wafer (MPW) services. A detailed analysis of the setting of the bounds for the effective and group indices is presented to get the right extraction with improved accuracy.},

@article{Ma2015,
abstract = {In integrated photonics, the design goal of a polarization splitter/rotator (PSR) has been separating the TE0 and TM0 modes in a waveguide. This is a natural choice. But in theory, a PSR only needs to project the incoming State Of Polarization (SOP) orthogonally to its output ports, using any orthogonal mode basis set in the fiber. In this article, we introduce a novel PSR design that alternatively takes the linear combination of TE0 and TM0 (TE0 +/- TM0) as orthogonal bases. By contrast, existing approaches exclusively use TE0 and TM0 as their basis set. The design is based on two symmetric and robust structures: a bi-layer taper and a Y-junction, and involves no bends. To prove the concept, we incorporated it into a four-channel polarization insensitive wavelength division multiplexing (PI-WDM) receiver fabricated in a standard CMOS Si photonics process. 40 Gb/s data rate and 0.7 +/- 0.2 dB polarization dependent loss (PDL) is demonstrated on each channel. Lastly, we propose an improved PSR design with 12 $\mu$m device length, < 0.1 dB PDL, < 0.4 dB insertion loss and < 0.05 dB wavelength dependence across C-band for both polarizations. Overall, our PSR design concept is simple, easy to realize and presents a new perspective for future PSR designs.},

@article{Binkert2011,
abstract = {For large-scale networks, high-radix switches reduce hop and switch count, which decreases latency and power. The ITRS projections for signal-pin count and per-pin bandwidth are nearly flat over the next decade, so increased radix in electronic switches will come at the cost of less per-port bandwidth. Silicon nanophotonic technology provides a long-term solution to this problem. We first compare the use of photonic I/O against an all-electrical, Cray YARC inspired baseline. We compare the power and performance of switches of radix 64, 100, and 144 in the 45, 32, and 22 nm technology steps. In addition with the greater off-chip bandwidth enabled by photonics, the high power of electrical components inside the switch becomes a problem beyond radix 64. We propose an optical switch architecture that exploits high-speed optical interconnects to build a flat crossbar with multiple-writer, single-reader links. Unlike YARC, which uses small buffers at various stages, the proposed design buffers only at input and output ports. This simplifies the design and enables large buffers, capable of handling ethernet-size packets. To mitigate head-of-line blocking and maximize switch throughput, we use an arbitration scheme that allows each port to make eight requests and use two grants. The bandwidth of the optical crossbar is also doubled to to provide a 2x internal speedup. Since optical interconnects have high static power, we show that it is critical to balance the use of optical and electrical components to get the best energy efficiency. Overall, the adoption of photonic I/O allows 100,000 port networks to be constructed with less than one third the power of equivalent all-electronic networks. A further 50% reduction in power can be achieved by using photonics within the switch components. Our best optical design performs similarly to YARC for small packets while consuming less than half the power, and handles 80% more load for large message traffic.},

The resonance wavelength shift that occurs when the surroundings of a cavity is changed, is used for sensing. While theoretically the performance for bulk refractive index changes is moderate (10(-5)), this device performs outstanding in terms of absolute molecular mass sensing (theoretical sensitivity of 1fg molecular mass) thanks to its extremely small dimensions. We use the avidin/biotin high affinity couple to demonstrate good repeatability and detection of protein concentrations down to 10ng/ml. Fabrication with Deep UV lithography allows for cheap mass production and integration with electronic functions for complete lab-on-chip devices.},

@article{Melloni2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we report a direct comparison between coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) and photonic crystal waveguides (PhCWs), which have both been exploited as tunable delay lines. The two structures were fabricated on the same silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technological platform, with the same fabrication facilities and evaluated under the same signal bit-rate conditions. We compare the frequency- and time-domain response of the two structures; the physical mechanism underlying the tuning of the delay; the main limits induced by loss, dispersion, and structural disorder; and the impact of CROW and PhCW tunable delay lines on the transmission of data stream intensity and phase modulated up to 100 Gb/s. The main result of this study is that, in the considered domain of applications, CROWs and PhCWs behave much more similarly than one would expect. At data rates around 100 Gb/s, CROWs and PhCWs can be placed in competition. Lower data rates, where longer absolute delays are required and propagation loss becomes a critical issue, are the preferred domain of CROWs fabricated with large ring resonators, while at data rates in the terabit range, PhCWs remain the leading technology.},

We present a new experimental method to quantify the phase coherence length. The theory model is verified by both our and others' experiments. Coherence length is expected to become one key parameter of the fabrication non-uniformity to guide the design of silicon photonics.},

Split-wavelength separation of 0.68 nm for the 5-microm-radius ring, notch depth of 40 dB for the 10-microm-radius ring, and intrinsic Q factor of 2.6 x 10(5) for the 20-microm-radius ring are demonstrated. Notch depth improvement larger than 25 dB has been reached in the 40-39-microm-radius double-ring structure. The enhanced notch depth and increased modal area for the concentric rings might be promising advantages for bio-sensing applications.},

abstract = {We demonstrate continuous wave four-wave mixing in silicon photonic crystal waveguides of 396 $\mu$m length with a group index of ng=30. The highest observed conversion efficiency is -24 dB for 90 mW coupled input pump power. The key question we address is whether the predicted fourth power dependence of the conversion efficiency on the slowdown factor ($\eta$≈S4) can indeed be observed in this system, and how the conversion efficiency depends on device length in the presence of propagation losses. We find that the expected dependencies hold as long as both realistic losses and the variation of mode shape with slowdown factor are taken into account. Having achieved a good agreement between a simple analytical model and the experiment, we also predict structures that can achieve the same conversion efficiency as already observed in nanowires for the same input power, yet for a device length that is 50 times shorter.},

Sidewall roughness is a major source of loss and an impediment to realizing high-transmission Si waveguides. The postetch multistepped approach allows for efficient smoothing (in terms of roughness amplitude reduction to material consumption) by continuous oxidation in the fast reaction-limited regime. This method reduces waveguide transmission loss without sacrificing dimensional integrity or thermal budget. In this proof-of-concept work, Si waveguide sidewall loss has been reduced from 9.2 to 1.9 dB/cm.},

abstract = {We demonstrate for the first time a fully integrated electro-optic modulator based on locally strained silicon rib-waveguides. By depositing a Si3N4 strain layer directly on top of the silicon waveguide the silicon crystal is asymmetrically distorted. Thus its inversion symmetry is broken and a linear electro-optic effect is induced. Electro-optic characterization yields a record high value $\chi$(2)(yyz) = 122 pm/V for the second-order susceptibility of the strained silicon waveguide and a strict linear dependence between the applied modulation voltage V(mod) and the resulting effective index change $\Delta$n(eff). Spatially resolved micro-Raman and terahertz (THz) difference frequency generation (DFG) experiments provide in-depth insight into the origin of the electro-optic effect by correlating the local strain distribution with the observed second-order optical activity.},

abstract = {Two different silicon slot waveguide configurations are thoroughly analyzed to achieve the optimum nonlinear performance. In the slot region, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatible material made by silicon nanocrystals embedded in silica (SiO2) has been considered. This material has demonstrated very promising characteristics for nonlinear applications. The optimum parameters for each configuration are first designed to achieve maximum field confinement in the slot region. Minimum effective areas around 0.1 mum 2 are obtained for both configurations. The influence on the field confinement of the variation of the refractive index in the slot region and the variation of the sidewall angle is investigated. In the former, it is shown that the variation of the refractive index in the slot region has a small effect on both slot waveguide configurations. However, the influence of the sidewall angle on the field confinement depends on the configuration chosen},

abstract = {Photonic circuits, in which beams of light redirect the flow of other beams of light, are a long-standing goal for developing highly integrated optical communication components. Furthermore, it is highly desirable to use silicon-the dominant material in the microelectronic industry-as the platform for such circuits. Photonic structures that bend, split, couple and filter light have recently been demonstrated in silicon, but the flow of light in these structures is predetermined and cannot be readily modulated during operation. All-optical switches and modulators have been demonstrated with III-V compound semiconductors, but achieving the same in silicon is challenging owing to its relatively weak nonlinear optical properties. Indeed, all-optical switching in silicon has only been achieved by using extremely high powers in large or non-planar structures, where the modulated light is propagating out-of-plane. Such high powers, large dimensions and non-planar geometries are inappropriate for effective on-chip integration. Here we present the experimental demonstration of fast all-optical switching on silicon using highly light-confining structures to enhance the sensitivity of light to small changes in refractive index. The transmission of the structure can be modulated by up to 94% in less than 500 ps using light pulses with energies as low as 25 pJ. These results confirm the recent theoretical prediction of efficient optical switching in silicon using resonant structures.},

abstract = {It is known that light can be slowed down in dispersive materials near resonances. Dramatic reduction of the light group velocity-and even bringing light pulses to a complete halt-has been demonstrated recently in various atomic and solid state systems, where the material absorption is cancelled via quantum optical coherent effects. Exploitation of slow light phenomena has potential for applications ranging from all-optical storage to all-optical switching. Existing schemes, however, are restricted to the narrow frequency range of the material resonance, which limits the operation frequency, maximum data rate and storage capacity. Moreover, the implementation of external lasers, low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization and hinders practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an over 300-fold reduction of the group velocity on a silicon chip via an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides that can support an optical mode with a submicrometre cross-section. In addition, we show fast (approximately 100 ns) and efficient (2 mW electric power) active control of the group velocity by localized heating of the photonic crystal waveguide with an integrated micro-heater.},

Through equivalent circuit modeling, it is confirmed that device parasitics have a major impact on the bandwidth and the importance of each individual circuit element has been investigated. According to the extrapolation of the parameters derived from S<sub>11</sub> measurements below 20 GHz towards higher frequencies and assuming that the mesa capacitance can be reduced by adding a few extra oxide layers without significantly affecting series resistance, our model predicts that the 3-dB parasitic frequency can be increased from 22 to above 30 GHz. Accounting also for bandwidth limitations due to thermal effects, we expect an increase of the modulation bandwidth of several gigahertz which may enable direct current modulation at 40 Gb/s.},

Over recent years an impressive range of silicon-on-insulator devices has been realized, including waveguides(1,2), filters(3,4) and photonic-crystal devices(5). However, silicon-based all-optical switching is still challenging owing to the slow dynamics of two-photon generated free carriers. Here we show that silicon-organic hybrid integration overcomes such intrinsic limitations by combining the best of two worlds, using mature CMOS processing to fabricate the waveguide, and molecular beam deposition to cover it with organic molecules that efficiently mediate all-optical interaction without introducing significant absorption. We fabricate a 4-mm-long silicon-organic hybrid waveguide with a record nonlinearity coefficient of gamma approximate to 1 x 10(5) W-1 km(-1) and perform all-optical demultiplexing of 170.8 Gb s(-1) to 42.7 Gb s(-1). This is-to the best of our knowledge-the fastest silicon photonic optical signal processing demonstrated.},

This method offers a twofold advantage: The measuring range of the interferometer is twice as large as that of the Michelson interferometer, and the systematic error that is associated with the beam splitter is minimized because of the configuration. We report the results of measurements on various optical components performed in the 555--630-nm spectral region and propose a scheme for the processing of the experimental data.

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {Silicon microring resonators very often exhibit resonance splitting due to backscattering. This effect is hard to quantitatively and predicatively model. This paper presents a behavioral circuit model for microrings that quantitatively explains the wide variations in resonance splitting observed in experiments. The model is based on an in-depth analysis of the contributions to backscattering by both the waveguides and couplers. Backscattering transforms unidirectional microrings into bidirectional circuits by coupling the clockwise and counterclockwise circulating modes. In high-Q microrings, visible resonance splitting will be induced, but, due to the stochastic nature of backscattering, this splitting is different for each resonance. Our model, based on temporal coupled mode theory, and the associated fitting method, are both accurate and robust, and can also explain asymmetrically split resonances. The cause of asymmetric resonance splitting is identified as the backcoupling in the couplers. This is experimentally confirmed and its dependency on gap and coupling length is further analyzed. Moreover, the wide variation in resonance splitting of one spectrum is analyzed and successfully explained by our circuit model that incorporates most linear parasitic effects in the microring. This analysis uncovers multi-cavity interference within the microring as an important source of this variation.},

This DRA gain suppression, together with the reproduced pump FP spectrum at 15xx-nm signal band, may limit the usefulness of the forward-pumped DRA, generating spectrally nonuniform FWM-induced noise floors and crosstalk in wavelength-division-multiplexed fiber-optic transmission systems.},

abstract = {We present a versatile and accurate chromatic dispersion measurement method for single mode optical fibers over a wide spectral range (200 nm) using a spectral domain white light interferometer. This technique is based on spectral interferometry with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer setup and a broad band light source. It takes less than a second to obtain a spectral interferogram for a few tens of centimeter length fiber sample. We have demonstrated that the relative group velocity, the chromatic dispersion and the dispersion slope of a sample fiber can be obtained very accurately regardless of the zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW) of a sample after frequency dependent optical phase was directly retrieved from a spectral interferogram. The measured results with our proposed method were compared with those obtained with a conventional time-domain dispersion measurement method. A good agreement between those results indicates that our proposed method can measure the chromatic dispersion of a short length optical fiber with very high accuracy.},

We measure an instantaneous conversion efficiency of up to -9dB between the idler and the continuous-wave probe, with 1W peak pump power and 6 nm pump-probe detuning. This conversion efficiency is found to be considerably higher (>10 × ) than that of a Si nanowire with a group velocity ten times larger. In addition, we estimate the FWM bandwidth to be at least that of the flat band slow light window. These results, supported by numerical simulations, emphasize the importance of engineering the dispersion of PhC waveguides to exploit the slow light enhancement of FWM efficiency, even for short device lengths.},

It includes some discussion of why tunable lasers might be beneficial, an outline of basic tuning mechanisms,some examples of tunable lasers that have been commercialized, and a discussion of control techniques. More extensive data is given for the widely-tunable sampled-grating distributed-Bragg-reflector (SGDBR) type of laser, including data for such lasers integrated monolithically with modulators to form complete transmitter front ends. A summary of reliability data for the SGDBR laser is also given. It is concluded that tunable lasers can reduce operational costs, that full-band tunability is desirable for many applications, that monolithic integration offers the most potential for reducing size, weight,power and cost, and that sufficient reliability for system insertion has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {Multi-step processing for a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform was developed. It allows the incorporation of additional grooves and steps into the basic optical waveguide structures, so that light can be adiabatically coupled between waveguides with different cross-sections. The processes were based on simple fabrication methods easily scalable for mass production. Two options for the fabrication sequence were tested, both having one silicon etch step with an oxide mask and another etch step with a resist mask. The applicability of the developed processes was tested with different waveguide structures. An additional groove etched beside a bent 10??m thick rib waveguide suppressed the bend losses to below 1?dB/90? with a 5?mm bending radius. A waveguide mirror exhibited optical losses below 1?dB/90?. The excess losses of a vertical taper between 10 and 4??m thick rib waveguides were 0.7?dB. A converter between a rib and a strip waveguide showed negligible losses, below 0.07?dB.},

While new definitions reduce to standard definitions in some limits, significant differences are predicted, including a factor of approximately 2 higher value for gamma, for emerging waveguides and microstructured fibers.},

Preliminary experimental results are reported. An optical arrangement for absolute range-finding applications using tunable-laser sources (e.g., semiconductor lasers) is proposed.},

abstract = {This note reconsiders the morphological close-open and open-close filters for topology optimization introduced in an earlier paper (Sigmund Struct Multidiscip Optim 33(4–5):401–424 (2007)). Close-open and open-close filters are defined as the sequential application of four dilation or erosion filters. In the original paper, these filters were proposed in order to provide length scale control in both the solid and the void phase. However, it was concluded that the filters were not useful in practice due to the computational cost of the sensitivity analysis. In this note, it is shown that the computational cost is much lower if the sensitivity analysis for each erosion or dilation step is performed sequentially. Unfortunately, it is also found that the close-open and open-close filters do not have the expected effect in terms of length scale control: each close or open operation ruins the effect of the preceding filters, resulting in a design with a minimum length scale in either the solid phase or the void phase, but not both.},

The $\chi$((3)) values of V(2)O(5), Nb(2)O(5), and Ta(2)O(5) thin films were 1.1 × 10(-11), 1.3 × 10(-12), and 6.1 × 10(-13) esu, respectively, which corresponds to an increase in the average bond length I(b) of the order of V-O (I(b) = 0.183 nm), Nb-O (I(b) = 0.200 nm), and Ta-O (I(b) = 0.204 nm). The current and previous results indicate that $\chi$((3)) of these transition metal oxides with the empty d orbitals is dominated mainly by the metal-oxygen bond length rather than the valence of the metal cation. It is predicted on the basis of Lines' model that transition metal oxides with the shortest I(b) exhibit the highest $\chi$((3)), whereas nontransition metal oxides with the longest I(b) exhibit the highest $\chi$((3)).},

The contents include such important topics as self- and cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering, four-wave mixing, modulation instability, and optical solutons. A proper understanding of these topics is essential for scientists and engineers interested in various aspects of lightwave technology. Such an ambitious objective increased the size of the book to the extent that it was necessary to create a separate but complimentary book, Applications of Nonlinear Fiber Optics, which is devoted to applications in the domain of lightwave technology. This revised edition of Nonlinear Fiber Optics should serve well the needs of the scientific community including graduate students in Optics, Physics, and Electrical Engineering, engineers in the optical communication industry, and scientists working in fiber optics and nonlinear optics. Only book dealing with Nonlinear Fiber Optics Comprehensive up-to-date coverage of the entire field Problems at the end of each chapter suitable for a course Focus on fundamental aspects Can be used by graduate students doing research in or taking courses in nonlinear optics and optical communications},

The method is based on a heterodyne Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which is immune to thermal phase noise by using a counterpropagating reference beam. Chromatic dispersion profiles are obtained over a broad wavelength region even in short waveguides with considerable loss. Conventional strip silicon waveguides as well as slotted geometries are considered. Theoretical simulations are also presented for comparison, which show good agreement with the experimental results.},

We have demonstrated intensity modulation of light with light in a silicon-polymer waveguide device, based on the all-optical Kerr effect-the ultrafast effect used in four-wave mixing. Direct measurements of time-domain intensity modulation are made at speeds of 10 GHz. We showed experimentally that the mechanism of this modulation is ultrafast through spectral measurements, and that intensity modulation at frequencies in excess of 1 THz can be obtained. By integrating optical polymers through evanescent coupling to silicon waveguides, we greatly increase the effective nonlinearity of the waveguide, allowing operation at continuous-wave power levels compatible with telecommunication systems. These devices are a first step in the development of large-scale integrated ultrafast optical logic in silicon, and are two orders of magnitude faster than previously reported silicon devices.},

abstract = {Silicon photonics meets the electronics requirement of increased speed and bandwidth with on-chip optical networks. All-optical data management requires nonlinear silicon photonics. In silicon only third-order optical nonlinearities are present owing to its crystalline inversion symmetry. Introducing a second-order nonlinearity into silicon photonics by proper material engineering would be highly desirable. It would enable devices for wideband wavelength conversion operating at relatively low optical powers. Here we show that a sizeable second-order nonlinearity at optical wavelengths is induced in a silicon waveguide by using a stressing silicon nitride overlayer. We carried out second-harmonic-generation experiments and first-principle calculations, which both yield large values of strain-induced bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, up to 40 pm V(-1) at 2,300 nm. We envisage that nonlinear strained silicon could provide a competing platform for a new class of integrated light sources spanning the near- to mid-infrared spectrum from 1.2 to 10 $\mu$m.},

@article{Foster2006,
abstract = {Developing an optical amplifier on silicon is essential for the success of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic integrated circuits. Recently, optical gain with a 1-nm bandwidth was demonstrated using the Raman effect, which led to the demonstration of a Raman oscillator, lossless optical modulation and optically tunable slow light. A key strength of optical communications is the parallelism of information transfer and processing onto multiple wavelength channels. However, the relatively narrow Raman gain bandwidth only allows for amplification or generation of a single wavelength channel. If broad gain bandwidths were to be demonstrated on silicon, then an array of wavelength channels could be generated and processed, representing a critical advance for densely integrated photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate net on/off gain over a wavelength range of 28 nm through the optical process of phase-matched four-wave mixing in suitably designed SOI channel waveguides. We also demonstrate wavelength conversion in the range 1,511-1,591 nm with peak conversion efficiencies of +5.2 dB, which represents more than 20 times improvement on previous four-wave-mixing efficiencies in SOI waveguides. These advances allow for the implementation of dense wavelength division multiplexing in an all-silicon photonic integrated circuit. Additionally, all-optical delays, all-optical switches, optical signal regenerators and optical sources for quantum information technology, all demonstrated using four-wave mixing in silica fibres, can now be transferred to the SOI platform.},

Additionally, we theoretically analyze the transient effects and degradations due to free carrier absorption, free carrier refraction and two photon absorption effects. Results suggest that at low peak power levels the system is governed by Kerr nonlinearities. As the input power levels increase the free carrier effects becomes dominant. Effect of free carrier generation on continuum generation and power transfer also theoretically analyzed and spectral broadening factor for high input power levels is estimated.},

abstract = {Metal interconnections are expected to become the limiting factor for the performance of electronic systems as transistors continue to shrink in size. Replacing them by optical interconnections, at different levels ranging from rack-to-rack down to chip-to-chip and intra-chip interconnections, could provide the low power dissipation, low latencies and high bandwidths that are needed. The implementation of optical interconnections relies on the development of micro-optical devices that are integrated with the microelectronics on chips. Recent demonstrations of silicon low-loss waveguides, light emitters, amplifiers and lasers approach this goal, but a small silicon electro-optic modulator with a size small enough for chip-scale integration has not yet been demonstrated. Here we experimentally demonstrate a high-speed electro-optical modulator in compact silicon structures. The modulator is based on a resonant light-confining structure that enhances the sensitivity of light to small changes in refractive index of the silicon and also enables high-speed operation. The modulator is 12 micrometres in diameter, three orders of magnitude smaller than previously demonstrated. Electro-optic modulators are one of the most critical components in optoelectronic integration, and decreasing their size may enable novel chip architectures.},

abstract = {We use the coupling matrix formalism to investigate continuous wave and pulse propagation through microring coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs). The dispersion relation agrees with that derived using the tight-binding model in the limit of weak inter-resonator coupling. We obtain an analytical expression for pulse propagation through a semi-infinite CROW in the case of weak coupling which fully accounts for the nonlinear dispersive characteristics. We also show that intensity of a pulse in a CROW is enhanced by a factor inversely proportional to the inter-resonator coupling. In finite CROWs, anomalous dispersions allows for a pulse to propagate with a negative group velocity such that the output pulse appears to emerge before the input as in "superluminal" propagation. The matrix formalism is a powerful approach for microring CROWs since it can be applied to structures and geometries for which analyses with the commonly used tight-binding approach are not applicable.},

abstract = {It is known that light can be slowed down in dispersive materials near resonances. Dramatic reduction of the light group velocity-and even bringing light pulses to a complete halt-has been demonstrated recently in various atomic and solid state systems, where the material absorption is cancelled via quantum optical coherent effects. Exploitation of slow light phenomena has potential for applications ranging from all-optical storage to all-optical switching. Existing schemes, however, are restricted to the narrow frequency range of the material resonance, which limits the operation frequency, maximum data rate and storage capacity. Moreover, the implementation of external lasers, low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization and hinders practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an over 300-fold reduction of the group velocity on a silicon chip via an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides that can support an optical mode with a submicrometre cross-section. In addition, we show fast (approximately 100 ns) and efficient (2 mW electric power) active control of the group velocity by localized heating of the photonic crystal waveguide with an integrated micro-heater.},

abstract = {Most datacenter network (DCN) designs focus on maximizing bisection bandwidth rather than minimizing server-to-server latency. We explore architectural approaches to building low-latency DCNs and introduce Quartz, a design element consisting of a full mesh of switches. Quartz can be used to replace portions of either a hierarchical network or a random network. Our analysis shows that replacing high port-count core switches with Quartz can significantly reduce switching delays, and replacing groups of top-of-rack and aggregation switches with Quartz can significantly reduce congestion-related delays from cross-traffic. We overcome the complexity of wiring a complete mesh using low-cost optical multiplexers that enable us to efficiently implement a logical mesh as a physical ring. We evaluate our performance using both simulations and a small working prototype. Our evaluation results confirm our analysis, and demonstrate that it is possible to build low-latency DCNs using inexpensive commodity elements without significant concessions to cost, scalability, or wiring complexity.},

The device is very compact and couples light only to transverse-electric modes of the planar waveguides.

Recently, a novel approach in photonic integration is emerging which will reduce the R&D and prototyping costs and the throughput time of PICs by more than an order of magnitude. It will bring the application of PICs that integrate complex and advanced photonic functionality on a single chip within reach for a large number of small and larger companies and initiate a breakthrough in the application of Photonic ICs.

The spectrum of light reflected from the FBG sensor is analyzed using an AWG, which acts as a coarse spectrometer. Using measurement points from the AWG channels, the original spectrum of the sensing element is reconstructed by means of curve fitting. The measurement system is modeled in the LabView environment, which allows the modification of the FBG and AWG parameters and simulating the measurement process. This, in turn, allows the quantification of the measurement errors resulting from the nonlinearity of the particular FBG/AWG configuration, and allows the optimization of the system design for the particular measurement errors permitted. In addition to the simulations of the proposed measurement system, we provide details of the laboratory evaluation.},

This laser runs continuous-wave (c.w.) with a threshold of 65 mA, a maximum output power of 1.8 mW with a differential quantum efficiency of 12.7 % and a maximum operating temperature of 40 degrees C. This approach allows for 100's of lasers to be fabricated in one bonding step, making it suitable for high volume, low-cost, integration. By varying the silicon waveguide dimensions and the composition of the III-V layer, this architecture can be extended to fabricate other active devices on silicon such as optical amplifiers, modulators and photo-detectors.},

We demonstrate both numerically and experimentally the generation of SPM-broadened pulses centred at 1542 nm with 92% of the pulse energy remaining within the 29 nm 3 dB spectral bandwidth. Applications in spectra slicing and pulse compression are demonstrated.},

@article{Melati2014,
abstract = {Real photonic waveguides are affected by structural imperfections due to fab- rication tolerances that cause scattering phenomena when the light propagates through. These effects result in extrinsic propagation losses associated with the excitation of radiation and backscattering modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive review on the extrinsic loss mechanisms occurring in optical waveguides, identifying the main origins of scattering loss and pointing out the relationships between the loss and the geometrical and physical parameters of the waveguides. Theoretical models and experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, are presented for two widespread classes of waveguides: waveguides based on total internal reflection (TIR) affected by surface rough- ness, and disordered photonic crystal slab waveguides (PhCWs). In both struc- tures extrinsic losses are strongly related to the waveguide group index, but the mode shape and its interaction with waveguide imperfections must also be con- sidered to accurately model the scattering loss process. It is shown that as long as the group index of PhCWs is relatively low (ng < 30), many analogies exist in the radiation and backscattering loss mechanisms with TIR waveguides; con- versely, in the high ng regime, multiple scattering and localization effects arise in PhCWs that dramatically modify the waveguide behavior. The presented results enable the development of reliable circuit models of photonic wave- guides, which can be used for a realistic performance evaluation of optical circuits. {\textcopyright}},

Focusing grating lines have also been used to reduce the footprint of the design. Our sub-wavelength grating couplers for the TE and TM modes show respective measured insertion losses of 4.1 dB and 3.7 dB with 1-dB bandwidths of 30.6 nm (3-dB bandwidth of 52.3 nm) and 47.5 nm (3-dB bandwidth of 81.5 nm), respectively.},

abstract = {Following significant research and development work over the past few years, silicon photonics has become a promising candidate to provide low-power, low-cost, and high-speed photonic links for telecommunication, data communication, and interconnect applications. A high-speed optical modulator is one of the critical components for these links. In this paper, we report on our recent progress in the development of a GeSi electro-absorption (EA) modulator based on the Franz-Keldysh effect (FKE) integrated in a 3-$\mu$m silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. We first discuss the FKE in GeSi, and describe the EA modulator device design and fabrication. We then report on the performance of the fabricated device. Finally, we describe the monolithic integration of four modulators with a four channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) echelle grating to demonstrate a 112 Gbit/s (4 × 28 Gbit/s) WDM transmitter chip. This chip establishes silicon photonics as an enabling technology for low-power and low-cost data transmission applications.},

One source of error is the limit of an underlying approximation for long interferometer path mismatches and fast laser tuning rates. A second source of error is transmission delays in data acquisition hardware. We show that the measurement system can be configured such that the two error sources cancel to second order.

abstract = {We revisit the problem of the optimization of a silicon-nanocrystal (Si-NC) waveguide, aiming to attain the maximum field confinement inside its nonlinear core and to ensure optimal waveguide performance for a given mode power. Using a Si-NC/SiO2 slot waveguide as an example, we show that the common definition of the effective mode area may lead to significant errors in estimation of optical intensity governing the nonlinear optical response and, as a result, to poor strength evaluation of the associated nonlinear effects. A simple and physically meaningful definition of the effective mode area is given to relate the total mode power to the average field intensity inside the nonlinear region and is employed to study the optimal parameters of Si-NC slot waveguides.},

abstract = {Wave mixing inside optical resonators, while experiencing a large enhancement of the nonlinear interaction efficiency, suffers from strong bandwidth constraints, preventing its practical exploitation for processing broad-band signals. Here we show that such limits are overcome by the new concept of travelling-wave resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). This approach combines the efficiency enhancement provided by resonant propagation with a wide-band conversion process. Compared with conventional FWM in bare waveguides, it exhibits higher robustness against chromatic dispersion and propagation loss, while preserving transparency to modulation formats. Travelling-wave resonant FWM has been demonstrated in silicon-coupled ring resonators and was exploited to realize a 630-$\mu$m-long wavelength converter operating over a wavelength range wider than 60 nm and with 28-dB gain with respect to a bare waveguide of the same physical length. Full compatibility of the travelling-wave resonant FWM with optical signal processing applications has been demonstrated through signal retiming and reshaping at 10 Gb s(-1).},

Ultrafast dynamics with 0.2-1.5 ps lifetimes were also found consistent with carrier heating and spectral hole burning.

abstract = {An extension to the Fabry-Perot interferometric method is demonstrated to calculate the optical loss and the reflectivity for optical waveguides simultaneously. The method uses an excitation of the waveguide with a broadband amplified spontaneous emission source (a superluminescent diode in our case) and curve fitting to account for the change of input power, thereby simplifying the measurement procedure. The use of a broadband source as opposed to tunable lasers allows for simultaneous measurements over multiple wavelengths and decreased sensitivity to reflections in the cavity. Further, waveguides of different lengths are measured to calculate the optical loss and the reflectivity simultaneously. It is shown that, if the value for reflectivity is assumed, there could be a large error in the measurement of loss especially for short waveguides. Optical loss for ridge waveguides is measured and compared by using a tunable laser as the input source. The method can be used for a generic case where it is suspected that the input power changes during the measurement.},

abstract = {For decades, silicon has been the material of choice for mass fabrication of electronics. This is in contrast to photonics, where passive optical components in silicon have only recently been realized. The slow progress within silicon optoelectronics, where electronic and optical functionalities can be integrated into monolithic components based on the versatile silicon platform, is due to the limited active optical properties of silicon. Recently, however, a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser was demonstrated; if an effective modulator could also be realized in silicon, data processing and transmission could potentially be performed by all-silicon electronic and optical components. Here we have discovered that a significant linear electro-optic effect is induced in silicon by breaking the crystal symmetry. The symmetry is broken by depositing a straining layer on top of a silicon waveguide, and the induced nonlinear coefficient, chi(2) approximately 15 pm V(-1), makes it possible to realize a silicon electro-optic modulator. The strain-induced linear electro-optic effect may be used to remove a bottleneck in modern computers by replacing the electronic bus with a much faster optical alternative.},

abstract = {Focus Serial: Frontiers of Nonlinear Optics Several kinds of nonlinear optical effects have been observed in recent years using silicon waveguides, and their device applications are attracting considerable attention. In this review, we provide a unified theoretical platform that not only can be used for understanding the underlying physics but should also provide guidance toward new and useful applications. We begin with a description of the third-order nonlinearity of silicon and consider the tensorial nature of both the electronic and Raman contributions. The generation of free carriers through two-photon absorption and their impact on various nonlinear phenomena is included fully within the theory presented here. We derive a general propagation equation in the frequency domain and show how it leads to a generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation when it is converted to the time domain. We use this equation to study propagation of ultrashort optical pulses in the presence of self-phase modulation and show the possibility of soliton formation and supercontinuum generation. The nonlinear phenomena of cross-phase modulation and stimulated Raman scattering are discussed next with emphasis on the impact of free carriers on Raman amplification and lasing. We also consider the four-wave mixing process for both continuous-wave and pulsed pumping and discuss the conditions under which parametric amplification and wavelength conversion can be realized with net gain in the telecommunication band.},

most with the pattern density within a radius of 200 &#x00B5;m,
with a correlation coefficient of 0.57. No correlation between pattern
density and the intra-die systematic thickness variation is observed.
